# Credit Risk Modelling

A machine learning-based project to assess the risk of default associated with loan applicants. This project walks through data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and interpretation.

## 📋 Project Overview

Credit risk modelling helps financial institutions determine the probability of a customer defaulting on a loan. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can classify whether a customer is likely to repay or default on a loan.

## 🎯 Goal

To create a model that assists in better credit risk decisions by classifying loan applicants as low or high risk.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rajk0808/Credit-Risk-Modelling.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
